CSC-241 - Lab 4

The purpose of lab 4 was to solve the sleeping barbers problem using ezipc,
a simplified version of semaphores and shared memory made for novice coders.
There were a number of semaphores and shared memories that I used in order to 
make everything print out in the correct order. 

COMPILATION: gcc Lab4.c
TO RUN: ./a.out
